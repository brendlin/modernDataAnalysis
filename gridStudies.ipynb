    "**Active (real) Power**: Power transferred to the load, e.g. the component of the AC current in which the voltage and (positive) current are in phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reactive Power**: The component of the power in which the voltage and current are $90^\\circ$ out of phase, e.g. caused by inductive or capacitive features in the circuit. Common unit is `VAr` or `MVAr` (mega-volt-ampere reactive). Certain loads *require* reactive power, and therefore a technique called **reactive compensation** is used to provide that required reactive power, using e.g. a **shunt capacitor**.\n",

    "**Apparent Power**: The magnitude of the complex power, $|S|$.\n",

    "**Power factor**: The ratio of real (active) power and the apparent (total complex) power, ranging from $-1$ (completely reactive) to $+1$ (completely active). Also sometimes referred to as the $\\bf{\\cos(\\phi)}$.\n",

    "**Overcurrent**: A situation with excess current in the circuit, often resulting in excess heat generation or equipment damage. Causes: short circuit; excessive load; design issues; arc faults; ground faults. Solutions include circuit breakers and fuses, as well as current limiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single-phase electrical power**: A circuit or distribution system in which a single alternating current is present, typical of the 50-60 Hz currents in residential applications (heating and lighting). Main disadvantages:\n",
    " - a single-phase motor does not produce a rotating magnetic field; instead, it requires additional circuits to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two-phase electrical power**: Consists of two wires, with current out of phase by 1/4 cycle. Advantages/disadvantages:\n",
    " - The power delivered is constant.\n",
    " - Two-phase electrical power is provided by a four-wire circuit.\n",
    " - In principle the power is constant, however two-phase power is susceptible to pulsations in power, which can cause e.g. mechanical stress in motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three-phase electrical power**: Consists of three transmission wires, each carrying an alternating current with an period offset of 1/3. It has several benefits compared to two-phase electrical power:\n",
    " - A fourth neutral (return) conductor therefore carries very little or no current, and thus can have a much smaller gauge.\n",
    " - Summing all three components, the power delivered is constant.\n",

    "In Europe, a 400V (RMS) three-phase system, the voltage between any two lines (the **line voltage**) is 400V.

    "**Power flow vs Optimal power flow**: The power flow can be numerically solved for e.g. the voltage, voltage phase angle, and the real and reactive power flowing through each line. The Optimal power flow is one such calculation that also determines the minimal cost per kilowatt, presumably assuming that the generator outputs are degress of freedom that can be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slack bus**: This is the bus, generally a generator bus, that is used to balance the active and reactive power (i.e. absorbing reactive power from the transmission lines and other elements) in the system. It defines the system's reference phase angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**State Estimation**: Given measurements of the bus voltages, bus $p$ and $q$, and line $p$, with their uncertainties, use a least squares estimator to better constrain the system and therefore reduce the uncertainties of said measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit commitment**: This refers to the [day-ahead] planning process of determining which generators (and/or subunits) to commit to generation for the upcoming e.g. days. This is particularly important for generators that have a longer warm-up time. Also, in a free-market system, it may not be possible to instruct certain units to shut off completely (?).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distribution Grid**: This is the medium-range grid that lowers the transmission line voltage down to 2-35 kV level, where it is then distributed to e.g. a residential area, and finally stepped down to \"operational usage\" (220V).\n",

    "**Induction motor**: This type of motor creates a magnetic field in the stator, which *then produces a magnetic field in the rotor*, and then the relative offest between the stator and the rotor causes the rotor to *spontaneously* start rotating. The rotor will always rotate slightly slower than the stator magnetic field, therefore causing a *slip* of 1-5%.

The symmetrical components are referred to as \"direct\" (positive), \"inverse\" (negative), and zero (homopolar).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a three-phase circuit transmitted by wires ABC, in which the peaks of the dominant amplitude arrives in that order (ABC), each with a 120$^\\circ$ phase offset, and call this the direct or positive component. Then the **negative sequence current** refers to the component whose phases are oriented in the inverse direction (CBA). Finally, a third configuration exists, one in which all three phases are aligned (**Zero sequence current**) If there is no return line, then a zero sequence current cannot exist. Any *balanced* three-phase circuit can be described using a linear combination of these three components.\n",

Future redispatch procurement in Germany](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Publikationen/Studien/future-redispatch-procurement-in-germany.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2) The main issue that this report points out is that a \"last-minute\" market will be subject to perverse incentives (so-called \"inc-dec\" strategies). Generators in regions of **scarcity** will lower their price in order to “price themselves into the market,” knowing that they can “buy back” their energy (e.g. not produce the energy) at a higher price. Generators in regions of **abundance** will raise their price to withhold their energy, knowing that they will be able to sell their energy at a higher cost in the redispatch market. The final report of the project \"Beschaffung von Redispatch\" commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Project No. 055/17) (October 2019) recommends against a last-minute market, in favor of a few other proposed measures.\n",

This paper describes how a \"last-minute\" market (after the 15-minute market) can be used to resolve schedule deviations from renewable energy sources, which have become quite dramatic with the introduction of more renewable energy sources. The market can be constructed by making a call for bids based on both the schedule deviation forecast and the line capacity forecast. Bidders include batteries, electrolyzers, and combined heat and power (CHP) plants. These sources can either consume or produce energy (also electrolyzers?) to balance the grid, as needed. The costs are paid by the renewable source, e.g. the wind turbine operators. Overall costs of the system can be reduced in this way (also by the system operators, who pay less in balance compensation).\n",
